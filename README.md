# Discord Self-Bot

Welcome to this Discord self-bot! A few additional steps are required to make it functional.

First, download Self-Bot.py.

Next, using the IDE of your choice (we used Pycharm Community Edition), create two additional files.

Name the first one, 'password.txt' (without quotes). Type your Discord password in that file.

The second file is, 'token.txt' (without quotes). Open Discord on your browser and Inspect the page (using Ctrl+Shift+I on Chrome and Firefox).

There, find the Storage tab (if it is not visible click the arrows at the top to go over to it).

Then, go over to Local Storage on the left sidebar, and click it to find https://discord.com. From there, scroll down to the S section.

Reload the page. There will be a very brief interval where the token is visible. Quickly double-click the value after token and copy it (ctrl-c).

If you fail to copy it in time, try again by reloading the page.

Once you have the value copied, paste it into 'token.txt' (without quotes, if any).

Run the program. If you see any errors, try following this guide again carefully.

Enjoy!
